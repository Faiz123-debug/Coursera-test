	<h1>I HAD TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW ON MY BIRTHDAY.</h1>
	<h2>Thanks to Coursera that I got such a wonderful opportunity to learn something different and exciting. Finally, learning a language of the computer. Till now I have been learning human languages but this is first time that I am learning language of a machine</h2>
	<h3>Finally, I am learning programming which is best gift I'd ever give to my self.</h3>
	<h4>In the beginning it was really hard to understand even basics.But now I can easily develop a website for you. Learning with the help of Coursera and John Hopkins University at home. Feeling blessed with an awesome 머리..난 똑똑한 사람인가봐..진짜 언어의 천재이다.이봐,..어떻게 여기까지 왔는지 나도 잘 모른다..</h4>
